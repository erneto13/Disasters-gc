# This disaster spawns meteors that fall from the sky
# and explode on impact, increasing in intensity over time.
# ==========================================

# Spawn Settings
# --------------

# How often meteors should spawn (in ticks, 20 ticks = 1 second)
# Example: 5 = meteors spawn every 0.25 seconds
spawn-rate: 5

# Distance from the arena where meteors are spawned (in blocks)
# Example: 30.0 = meteors start 30 blocks away from arena center
spawn-distance: 30.0

# Multiplier for how far to the sides meteors can spawn
# Example: 1.0 = normal angles, 2.0 = wider lateral angles
lateral-offset-multiplier: 1.0

# Minimum height above the arena where meteors spawn (in blocks)
# Example: 20.0 = meteors will spawn at least 20 blocks above
spawn-height-min: 20.0

# Maximum height above the arena where meteors spawn (in blocks)
# Example: 60.0 = meteors can spawn up to 60 blocks higher
spawn-height-max: 60.0

# Intensity Settings
# ------------------

# The initial amount of meteors spawned per wave
# Example: 10 = start with 10 meteors each spawn cycle
initial-intensity: 10

# The maximum intensity (limit of meteors spawned per cycle)
# Example: 40 = even if intensity keeps increasing, it won't exceed 40
max-intensity: 40

# How often the intensity should increase (in ticks)
# Example: 60 = every 3 seconds the intensity will increase
intensity-increase-rate: 60

# How many meteors are added to the intensity each increase
# Example: 2 = every 60 ticks, 2 extra meteors will be added
intensity-increase-amount: 2

# Meteor Properties
# -----------------

# The minimum visual and physical size of meteors
# Example: 0.8 = small meteors
min-size: 0.8

# The maximum visual and physical size of meteors
# Example: 2.5 = huge meteors
max-size: 2.5

# Explosion power multiplier (applied to meteor size)
# Example: 3.5 = explosion power = meteor size * 3.5
explosion-multiplier: 3.5

# Movement Settings
# -----------------

# The falling speed of each meteor
# Example: 0.8 = medium speed; lower = slower, higher = faster
fall-speed: 0.8

# The maximum lifetime of a meteor before it disappears (in ticks)
# Example: 300 = 15 seconds before despawning if no impact occurs
max-lifetime-ticks: 300

# Visual & Audio Effects
# ----------------------

# Enable particle effects for meteors (simplified trail only)
# Includes: flame trail and light smoke
enable-particles: true

# Enable sound effects for meteors
# Includes: falling sound and explosion sounds
enable-sounds: true

# Enable circular impact wave on meteor landing
enable-impact-wave: true

# DO NOT TOUCH THIS!
config-version: 1
