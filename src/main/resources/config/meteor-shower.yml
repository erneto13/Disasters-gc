# This configuration controls the behavior of the Meteor Shower disaster.
# Each setting affects spawn frequency, explosion strength, and visuals.
# ==============================================================
# Units:
# - Time is measured in ticks (20 ticks = 1 second)
# - Distances are measured in blocks
# ==============================================================

# How often meteors should spawn (in ticks)
# Example: 5 = meteors spawn every 0.25 seconds
spawn-rate: 5

# The initial amount of meteors spawned per wave
# Example: 10 = start with 10 meteors each spawn cycle
initial-intensity: 10

# The maximum intensity (limit of meteors spawned per cycle)
# Example: 40 = even if the intensity keeps increasing, it will never exceed 40
max-intensity: 40

# How often the intensity should increase (in ticks)
# Example: 60 = every 3 seconds the intensity will increase
intensity-increase-rate: 60

# How many meteors are added to the intensity each increase
# Example: 2 = every 60 ticks, 2 extra meteors will be added
intensity-increase-amount: 2

# Distance from the arena where meteors are spawned
# Example: 30.0 = meteors start 30 blocks away from the arena center
spawn-distance: 30.0

# Multiplier for how far to the sides meteors can spawn
# Example: 2.0 = meteors may come from wider lateral angles
lateral-offset-multiplier: 2.0

# Minimum height above the arena where meteors spawn
# Example: 20.0 = meteors will spawn at least 20 blocks above
spawn-height-min: 20.0

# Maximum height above the arena where meteors spawn
# Example: 60.0 = meteors can spawn up to 60 blocks higher
spawn-height-max: 60.0

# The minimum visual and physical size of meteors
# Example: 0.8 = small meteors
min-size: 0.8

# The maximum visual and physical size of meteors
# Example: 2.5 = huge meteors
max-size: 2.5

# Explosion power multiplier (applied to meteor size)
# Example: 3.5 = explosion power = meteor size * 3.5
explosion-multiplier: 3.5

# The falling speed of each meteor
# Example: 0.4 = medium speed; lower = slower, higher = faster
fall-speed: 0.4

# The downward force applied to the meteor trajectory
# Example: -0.6 = strong vertical descent; closer to 0 makes it more diagonal
downward-force: -0.6

# The maximum lifetime of a meteor before it disappears (in ticks)
# Example: 300 = 15 seconds before despawning if no impact occurs
max-lifetime-ticks: 300

# Version of this configuration file
# Do not modify unless updating from a new version
config-version: 1
