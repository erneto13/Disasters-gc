# Flying Debris System Configuration
# This system makes blocks fly out from explosions and land naturally
# instead of dropping as items, creating more realistic destruction effects.
# ==========================================

# Enable/Disable System
# ---------------------

# Enable the debris system globally
enabled: true

# Explosion Debris Settings
# --------------------------

# Maximum number of debris pieces to spawn per explosion
# Higher = more realistic but can cause lag
# Recommended: 10-20 for small arenas, 15-30 for large arenas
max-debris-per-explosion: 15

# Base force multiplier for explosion debris
# Higher = debris flies further
# Example: 1.0 = normal distance, 2.0 = twice as far
explosion-force-multiplier: 1.0

# Enable random velocity variations
# Makes debris fly in slightly different directions for realism
random-velocity-variation: true

# Random variation range (0.0 to 1.0)
# Higher = more chaotic debris spread
velocity-randomness: 0.3

# Individual Block Break Settings
# --------------------------------

# Force for blocks broken individually (not by explosions)
# Used when blocks are destroyed by disasters like Acid Rain
individual-block-force: 1.5

# Upward bias for individual blocks
# Range: 0.0 (horizontal) to 1.0 (straight up)
# Recommended: 0.5-0.8 for natural looking arcs
upward-bias: 0.6

# Physics Settings
# ----------------

# Whether debris can hurt players when falling
# If true, debris acts like falling anvils
hurt-entities: true

# Damage dealt by falling debris (in half hearts)
# Only applies if hurt-entities is true
debris-damage: 2.0

# Whether debris has gravity
# Should always be true for realistic physics
enable-gravity: true

# Lifetime Settings
# -----------------

# Maximum time (in seconds) debris can exist before being removed
# Prevents lag from debris that gets stuck or flies away
max-lifetime-seconds: 10

# Whether to place blocks where debris lands
# true = debris becomes a solid block where it lands
# false = debris disappears when it hits the ground
place-on-landing: true

# Performance Settings
# --------------------

# Skip debris creation for these materials (to reduce lag)
# Add any blocks that would create too many debris pieces
blacklisted-materials:
- AIR
- CAVE_AIR
- VOID_AIR
- WATER
- LAVA
- FIRE
- SOUL_FIRE

# Minimum distance from explosion center to create debris
# Blocks closer than this won't become debris (reduces clutter)
min-debris-distance: 1.0

# Maximum distance from explosion center to create debris
# Blocks further than this won't become debris (prevents excessive spread)
max-debris-distance: 10.0

# Visual Settings (Future)
# -------------------------

# Enable particle trails behind flying debris
enable-particle-trails: false

# Particle type for debris trails
trail-particle: SMOKE

# Sound Settings (Future)
# ------------------------

# Enable impact sounds when debris lands
enable-impact-sounds: true

# Sound to play on debris impact
impact-sound: BLOCK_STONE_BREAK

# Impact sound volume
impact-sound-volume: 0.5

# Impact sound pitch
impact-sound-pitch: 0.8

# DO NOT TOUCH THIS!
config-version: 1
