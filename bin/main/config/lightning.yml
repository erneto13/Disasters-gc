# Lightning Disaster Configuration
# Strikes lightning bolts with powerful explosions
# ==========================================

# Strike Settings
# ---------------

# How often lightning strikes (in ticks, 20 = 1 second)
# Lower = more frequent strikes
# Examples: 1 = every tick (insane), 3 = every 0.15s (very fast), 10 = every 0.5s
strike-interval: 3

# Radius around players where lightning can strike (in blocks)
# Higher = more unpredictable
radius: 8

# Explosion Settings
# ------------------

# Explosion power (TNT = 4.0, Creeper = 3.0)
# Higher = bigger crater, more debris
# Recommended: 2.5 - 4.0
explosion-power: 3.5

# Whether explosions destroy blocks
# true = creates craters and debris
# false = only visual explosion
explosion-breaks-blocks: true

# Whether explosions set blocks on fire
# true = leaves fire after explosion (more chaos)
# false = no fire (recommended for most arenas)
explosion-sets-fire: false

# Damage Settings
# ---------------

# Damage multiplier for players near strikes
# 1.0 = normal, 2.0 = double damage, 0.0 = no extra damage
# Players take less damage the further they are from strike
damage-multiplier: 1.0

# Targeting Settings
# ------------------

# Target random players or always the same player
# true = strikes near random players (more fair)
# false = always targets first player (more focused)
target-random-players: true

# DO NOT TOUCH THIS!
config-version: 1
